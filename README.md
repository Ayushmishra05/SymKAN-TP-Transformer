# Decoder KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks)

## Task 1 :  Extracting the Data From the sources 
Starting off with the Data Extraction part, The Data was collected from the listed source, the data was in the Raw Text format, the first task was to convert this Raw text data into a CSV formatted dataset
* I have used re (python module), which is python module for regular expressions 
* The Dataset was converted into individual variables, and then was embedded into the dataset 
* Vertex was not consistent across the data, this might be the case because, some of the particle collisions doesn't happen between vertices but it only depends on the single vertex, that's why the case 


## Task 2 : Tokenization
